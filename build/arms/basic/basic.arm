### Define vector chains
# syntax: [member1, member2, member3, ..., membern]
>>> BEGIN VECTOR_CHAINS
["origin", "member1", "member2"]
>>> END

### Define members
# syntax: [length, mounting axis normal, direction, normal]
>>> BEGIN MEMBERS
["member1", 200, [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]
["member2", 100, [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]
>>> END

### Define controls
# syntax: not yet implemented
>>> BEGIN CONTROLS
# angle [("origin", "member1"), 0]
# angle [("member1", "member2"), 0]
>>> END
