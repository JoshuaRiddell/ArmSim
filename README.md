# ArmSim
## Generalised Robotic Arm Visualiser and Sequencer

### About
Developed under Windows 7, Python 3.4.2; V0.1

ArmSim is an interface which allows quick and simple movement sequencing of
complex robotic arms. It currently supports any robotic arm with chained
rotational joints, i.e., linear actuators and non-rigid joints are currently
not supported.

This was originally created for Assignment 3 of CSSE1001 at UQ in semester 1, 2015.
